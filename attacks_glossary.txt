2. Directory Traversal -

3. Log4J - A Java-based logging utility used to output log statements from applications to various output targets. 
A Log4j attack, also known as a log injection attack, is a type of security vulnerability in which an attacker injects 
malicious data into a log file generated by a Log4j-enabled application. This can allow the attacker to gain 
unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, or to manipulate the log data in some way.

4. Log Forging - 

5. Remote Code Execution (RCE) - A type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on 
a targeted system or device. This can be done remotely, without the need for physical access to the system.

6. SQL injection - A type of security exploit in which an attacker injects malicious code
into a website's SQLstatement and gains unauthorized access to the database. 
This can allow the attacker to modify or delete data, or even gain access
to sensitive information such as passwords or personal data. 
SQL injection attacks are a common method used by hackers to gain access to websites and databases, 
and they can be especially dangerous if the website or application does not have proper input validation and sanitization. 
To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to use prepared statements and parameterized queries and to properly sanitize all user input.

7. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) -
